## Introduction

Classical Density Functional Theory (CDFT) is a 
rigrous theoretical framework that builds statistical mechanics 
model of molecular liquid system in terms of its average density.
The `cdftpy` python package provides implementation of two CDFT methods -
the Renormalized Site Density Functional Theory (RSDFT) and Reference 
Interaction Site Model (RISM). At this stage of development, the code
allows to investigate the problem of ion solvation providing free energy
of solvation and solvent density profiles around the ion.

## Installation

1. Ensure that the version of python is 3.9 or higher

``` 
python3 --version
```
  
2. Change into the directory containing code distribution
   
3. Create virtual environment
   
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

4. Activate virtual environment
   
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
    
5. Install
   
```
pip install -e .
```

## Running from command line

---
### First steps
___

Running CDFT calculaton from the command line requires an input file.
Simple example of what it may look like for Cl- solvation calculation 
is given below: 

```
<solute>
#name   sigma(A)        eps(kj/mol)    charge(e)  
  Cl       4.83         0.05349244     -1.0      
```

Once the input file has been prepared, CDFT calculation can be run
using `cdft1d` executable script as shown below 

```
cdft1d <input_file>
```
In this simple case, RSDFT calculation will be performed using `s2` water model. The output will contain solvation free energy as well as peak
analysis of solvent density around the ion, e.g.

```
....

41    8.80e-08   -296.7836460

O 2nd peak position/height: 5.93 1.38  
O 1st min position/height: 4.44 0.54  
  
H 1st peak position/height: 2.16 8.00  
H 2nd peak position/height: 4.93 1.29  
H 1st min position/height: 3.26 0.37 
```

Single ion solvation calculation with RSDFT flavor of CDFT
can be performed as

where example input file for Cl- ion is given by

```
<solute>
#name   sigma(A)        eps(kj/mol)    charge(e)  
  Cl       4.83         0.05349244     -1.0      
<simulation>
  solvent s2
  method rsdft
  tol 1.0E-7
  max_iter 200
  output_rate 10
  rcoul 1.25
  rmax 100
```
The output will contain solvation free energy as well as peak
analysis of solvent density around the ion, e.g.

```
...

   Self-consistent cycle

H 1st peak position/height: 2.15 8.291  
H 2nd peak position/height: 4.92 1.301  
H 1st min position/height: 3.24 0.359  

```
The same calculation but with RISM methodology
can be run as

    cdft1d -m rism INPUT_FILE

___
### Calculation options
___
There are number options that may be used with `cdft1d`. The complete list
of those can be displayed by running

```
cdft1d --help
```

The choice of the calculation method, as mentioned earlier, is affected through `-m` option, which will default to RSDFT calculation. 

The choice of solvent is controlled by `-s` option, with default being the `s2` model. For example, the use of  `hcl` solvent can accomplished by

```
cdft1d -s hcl INPUT_FILE
```

To examine calculation results in greater detail, we can use `-d` option.
Used by itself 
```
cdft1d -d INPUT_FILE
```
it will open interactive dashboard in the dafault browser, where one can interactively examine solvent density profiles, solute-solvent potential of mean force, and solvent electrostatic potentials. Alternatively, the dashboard can be saved to html file (e.g. analysis.html)
```
cdft1d -d analysis.html INPUT_FILE
```
which can be opened at a later point. The content of
dashboard will depend on the type of the calculation. For example, for
single ion solvation calculation it will look like 
**[this](https://opencdft.github.io/cl.html)** and for multiple
parameter calculation as **[this](https://opencdft.github.io/charging.html)**
